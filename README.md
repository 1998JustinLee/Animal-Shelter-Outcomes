For the Small Group Discovery Experience (SGDE) portion of the course, we were tasked with having to choose a project from Kaggle to try and solve. We had to research and implement different machine learning concepts in Python. We completed the collaborative coding in Colaboratory and our result placed us at 835th out of 1601 teams.
